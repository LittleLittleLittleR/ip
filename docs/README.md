## Date & Time Formats

These formats are accepted wherever a date or datetime is required:

| Format               | Example                      | Notes                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `d-M-yyyy`         | `6-8-2026`                 | Day-Month-Year                                       |
| `yyyy-M-d`         | `2026-8-6`                 | Year-Month-Day                                       |
| Weekday abbreviation | `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed` … | Resolves to the**next** occurrence of that day |

Append a 24-hour time (`HHmm`) to any date format to include a time: `6-8-2026 1400` → 6 Aug 2026, 2:00 PM

## Command Summary

| `priority`  | Priority level (tasks with no priority go last)     |

---

### Undoing the last change — `undo`

Reverts the most recent command that modified the task list (e.g. add, delete, mark, edit).
View-only commands (`list`, `find`, `sort`, `stats`) are not counted. Only one level of undo is supported.

![`undo` command](image/README/undo.png)

### Viewing statistics — `stats`

Shows a breakdown of your task list by type, status, priority, and tags.

![`stats` command](image/README/stats.png)

### Archiving — `archive`

Saves all current tasks to a backup file and clears the list so you can start fresh. The backup is stored alongside your data file.

---

### Getting help — `help`

Shows the full list of available commands and accepted date/time formats directly in the chat.

![`help` command](image/README/help.png)

### Exiting — `bye`

Closes LittleR after a short delay.

### Data Storage

LittleR saves your tasks automatically to `./data/littler.txt` after every change — no manual saving needed. The file is created on first run if it does not exist.

> Do not edit the data file manually. Corrupted lines are skipped on load with a warning, but edits may cause data loss.
